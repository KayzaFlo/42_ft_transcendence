# ft_transcendence

This is our first web project, and we dove into it without any previous experience in web development.

Along the way, we encountered a number of inconsistencies in the project requirements, which presented us with some tough choices. One such decision was not to use the Django REST framework.

Despite these challenges and the limitations set by the project's requirements, we're quite happy with the results we've achieved, especially considering our initial limited knowledge.

Overall, it's been a great introduction to the world of web development!

# Getting started

## Prerequisite

To build this project you will need to have an instance of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) running.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/xApologize/ft_transcendence.git
    ```
2. Setting Up the Environment:
   - The project includes a [tool](https://github.com/xApologize/ft_transcendence/blob/main/tools/env_maker.sh) that simplifies the creation of the `.env` file needed for the project.
   - For 42 students who wish to use the 42 OAuth for login:
     1. Update the `.env` file in the backend folder.
     2. The `AUTH42_CLIENT` and `AUTH42_SECRET` values will be generated when you create your app on the intra.
     3. Fill in the `AUTH42_LINK` with the URL you obtained when creating your app.
     4. Set `AUTH42_REDIRECT_URI` to `https://your-domain/callback`. If you're working locally, you can use `localhost` instead.

  
3. Run the containers in the project root with
   ```
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
4. You can access the website with https://localhost
